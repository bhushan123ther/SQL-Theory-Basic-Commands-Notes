# Insert,Update and Delete anamolies

- Insert anamaly occurs when data cannot be inserted into a table because other required data is missing.

- A delete anomaly occurs when a record is deleted from a table, and as a result, data in other tables becomes inaccessible or meaningless. 

- Update anamaly occurs if we update one value then more than one row is updated.
