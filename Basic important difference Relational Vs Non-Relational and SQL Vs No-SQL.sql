/*
=> Relational Vs Non-Relational

Relational databases are based on the relational model with strict schema requirements,
while non-relational databases use various data models without strict schema requirements.

Relational databases are vertically scalable,
while non-relational databases are horizontally scalable.

Relational databases use SQL as a standard query language,
while non-relational databases typically use proprietary query languages.

Relational databases offer ACID guarantees,
while non-relational databases may offer eventual consistency.

Relational databases are commonly used for applications that require data integrity and strict relationships between tables,
while non-relational databases are commonly used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

/*

=> SQL Vs NO-SQL

->SQL database are relational
->NO-SQL database are non-relational

vertical scalability means adding more resources to a single server to handle increased workload, while horizontal scalability means adding more servers to handle the workload in a distributed fashion.

->SQL database are vertically scalable
->NO-SQL database are horizantally scalable

->SQL database have fixed or static or predefined schema.
->NO-SQL database have dynamic schema.

->SQL database are best suited for complex queries.
->NO-SQL database are not so good for complex queries.

->SQL database offer ACID gurantees, while NoSQL database typically offer eventual consistency.
   
->SQL databases are MYSQL,PostgreSQL,Oracle,MS-SQL Server,etc.
->NO-SQL databases are MongoDB,GraphQL,HBase,Neo4j,Cassandra,etc.
